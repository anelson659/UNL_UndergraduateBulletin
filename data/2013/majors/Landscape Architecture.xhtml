			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>Landscape architecture combines art and science. Landscape architects plan and design traditional places such as parks, residential developments, campuses, gardens, cemeteries, commercial centers, resorts, transportation facilities, corporate and institutional centers and waterfront developments. They also design and plan the restoration of natural places disturbed by humans such as wetlands, stream corridors, mined areas and forested land. Their appreciation for historic landscapes and cultural resources enables landscape architects to undertake preservation planning projects for national, regional and local historic sites and areas.</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>Working with architects, city planners, civil engineers and other professionals, landscape architects play an important role in environmental protection by designing and implementing projects that respect both the needs of people and of our environment. Therefore, landscape architects must be able to understand the process of nature and impact human settlement has on ecosystems. This requires professionals to manage storm water, select appropriate plan material, and anticipate human impact all with an eye on a sustainable future. </p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The goal of the Landscape Architecture Program is to nurture responsible citizens to address the complexity of world issues that face our discipline through creative and transformational design. Students will:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-1">achieve academic excellence so qualities of intellectual curiosity, open communication, personal responsibility, collegiality and the skills to work individually and with other’s are held to rigorously high standards;</li>
				<li class="bullet-1">receive the educational foundation for a professional career instilled with insightful design and planning ability, key technical skills, ethical judgment, and an ever-enhancing understanding of landscape architecture; and</li>
				<li class="bullet-1">be grounded in a broad base of knowledge within the curriculum, emphasizing connections among subjects that relate to and inform landscape architecture, thereby enabling investigative and problem-solving on all scales in a creative manner</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="title-1" xml:lang='en-us'>General</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The landscape architecture program is a four-year course of study that has been subdivided into a one-year pre-professional and a three-year professional degree. Students receive a professional bachelor of landscape architecture (BLA) at the end of the fourth year. At the end of the pre-professional year, students are required to apply for admission into the professional segment of the curriculum. This review involves an evaluation of the students academic record and a portfolio of their work during the pre-professional studies. The landscape architecture program is accredited by the Landscape Architectural Accreditation Board (LAAB).</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>Students are required to take an array of courses in support of the core studio sequence in addition to the university’s general education courses. These courses include material in horticulture, architecture, planning, and engineering in addition to core landscape architecture classes. This curriculum exposes students to various issues facing the landscape architecture profession including plant material, soils, landscape ecology, construction issues, stormwater management, infrastructure and issues created by urbanism. </p>
			<p class="content-box-h-1" xml:lang='en-us'>ADMISSION</p>
			<p class="title-1" xml:lang='en-us'>Admission to the Landscape Architecture Program</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>After completion of the pre-professional year, either within the College of Architecture or at another institution, students may apply for admission to the landscape architecture program.</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>Pre-landscape architecture majors should apply for admission to the professional program in landscape architecture. Successful applicants will have their major changed from pre-landscape architecture to BLA-Landscape Architecture option.</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>Available teaching resources and space capacities limit enrollment to the second year of landscape architectural studies; therefore enrollment limits are established each semester.</p>
			<p class="title-2" xml:lang='en-us'>Minimum Entrance Requirements</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>To be considered for admission to the landscape architecture program, applicants must:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list" xml:lang='en-us'>1. Be enrolled in the College of Architecture</p>
			<p class="numbered-list" xml:lang='en-us'>2. Be in good scholastic standing</p>
			<p class="numbered-list" xml:lang='en-us'>3. Have completed the 1st year pre-<span class="no-style-override-1">landscape architecture program</span> of study</p>
			<p class="title-1" xml:lang='en-us'>Second-Year Admission Process</p>
			<p class="numbered-list" xml:lang='en-us'>1. An application for admission may be completed by filling out the online application. The Program receives applications once a year in early February.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list" xml:lang='en-us'>2. Applicants must submit a portfolio conforming to the defined criteria for the program applied for by the date posted at the completion of the spring semester.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list" xml:lang='en-us'>3. Any applicant who has previously applied for admission and has not been accepted or who fails to enroll in the professional program in <span class="no-style-override-1">landscape </span>architecture after an acceptance must reapply in the regular manner. Students may apply for admission to the <span class="no-style-override-1">landscape architecture program</span> only three times.</p>
			<p class="title-2" xml:lang='en-us'>Evaluation</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>A faculty committee of the program will carefully evaluate the applications for admission. The committee considers three elements in their evaluation; cumulative grade point average, a weighted grade point average, and the portfolio of student work. The weighted grade point average gives additional value to the applicant’s achievement in the required LARC prefix course or transfer equivalents in the pre-professional curriculum.</p>
			<p class="title-2" xml:lang='en-us'>Selection</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>Admission to the landscape architecture program will be awarded to applicants who show the greatest professional potential and have demonstrated scholastic achievement. The faculty reserves the right to not fill all available spaces in the professional program in landscape architecture if it determines that the remaining applicants have not performed at an acceptable level.</p>
			<p class="content-box-h-1" xml:lang='en-us'>MAJOR REQUIREMENTS</p>
			<p class="title-1" xml:lang='en-us'>Specific Major Requirements</p>
			<p class="title-2" xml:lang='en-us'>Pre-Landscape Architecture Curriculum</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The pre-landscape curriculum begins with a one-year design core. This core introduces students to the fundamentals of design thinking and design making. The pre-landscape architecture program is followed by three years of focused landscape architecture instruction leading to a bachelor of landscape architecture. The professional bachelor of landscape architecture degree is the degree accredited by the Landscape Architectural Accreditation Board (LAAB).</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The College of Architecture, and all four years of the architecture program, are located in Lincoln. However, we do offer the option to do the first year of the program at UNO. After successfully completing the prescribed pre-landscape architecture program at UNO, students may transfer to UNL and apply for admission to the second year of study in the professional program of the College of Architecture.</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>For more information about courses at UNO, or transferring from UNO to UNL, please contact us.</p>
