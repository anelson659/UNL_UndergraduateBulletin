			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>Biological systems engineering (BSEN) is one of two engineering degree programs offered in the Department of Biological Systems Engineering. BSEN students emphasize engineering course work in one of three areas; biomedical engineering, food and bioproducts engineering, or environmental and water resources engineering. A biological systems engineer could work on systems to micropropagate tissue culture, develop biomaterials and biofibers, design equipment and processes for producing foods and biofuels, or design devices for performing minimally invasive surgery. Still another could be responsible for developing biological sensors and imaging devices for detecting diseases in humans, for measuring plant and animal stress, or for controlling the environment of greenhouses and animal facilities. Biological systems engineers could also be involved in resolving environmental issues associated with waste management, water quality and sustainable energy production. Job opportunities for graduates are available in industry, public agencies, consulting, and private practice. A significant number of graduates pursue graduate school or studies in medical or law school.</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>By two to six years after graduation, BSEN alumni will share the attribute of improving the organization for which they work, and the community and country in which they live. They will do this whether they are involved in biomedical engineering, environmental or water resources engineering, food or bioproducts engineering, or other professional endeavors such as business, law or medicine. In doing so, they will:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-1">provide innovative and effective solutions to problems in a variety of work environments through the use of their unique background in biological systems engineering and the biological sciences;</li>
				<li class="bullet-1">look beyond components in isolation thereby providing holistic solutions to complex issues involving (for example) interactions at the ecosystem, organism, organ, cellular or subcellular level;</li>
				<li class="bullet-1">think logically using appropriate elements of mathematics, science, and engineering to develop, manage, and interpret data, to correctly interpret new research findings, and to design new systems for the benefit of society;</li>
				<li class="bullet-1">successfully integrate technical knowledge with organizational, communication, and interpersonal skills to lead and work effectively in teams and to articulate the role of engineering decisions in the workplace, community and world;</li>
				<li class="bullet-1">responsibly address issues such as health and safety, personal and professional ethics, cultural diversity, as well as the social, environmental, and global impacts of their work; and</li>
				<li class="bullet-1">continue their personal growth, professional development, and professional and community service through various opportunities provided by institutions, professional organizations and other venues.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The Department of Biological Systems Engineering is located in Chase Hall on East Campus. BSEN students participate in classes and laboratories on both the East and City Campuses. BSEN courses are offered on the East Campus. Basic courses in math, chemistry, physics, engineering sciences, computers, and electives in mechanical, civil, electrical, and chemical engineering are taken on the City Campus. Convenient bus transportation is available between campuses.</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>Students benefit from small classes and personal acquaintances with faculty. In consultation with their adviser, students select electives that permit specialization in an emphasis area applicable to their career aspirations. Many students work part-time on departmental research projects, gaining valuable experience for employment in industry and for graduate or professional studies. Students also benefit from summer jobs, internships and co-op programs. These opportunities give students practical experience to learn about careers in engineering. Students also gain valuable experience through participation in professional organizations such as the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers, the Water and Environmental Federation, the Soil and Water Resources Club, the Biomedical Engineering Society, the Nebraska Society of Professional Engineers and the Society for Women Engineers.</p>
