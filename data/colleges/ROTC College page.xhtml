				<p class="title-2">Curriculum</p>

				<p class="basic-text">It is possible to minor in naval science under the integrated studies program of the College of Arts and Sciences. All interested students enrolled in that college are eligible.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">An integrated minor requires a minimum of 25 credit hours, including 10 in one department.

				<p class="basic-text">This integrated minor is available also to College of Agriculture and College of Education and Human Sciences students with the approval of their advisers.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">NOTE:</span> Although students may take additional naval science courses beyond the 12-credit-hour maximum, credit in these will not count toward a degree in the College of Arts and Sciences. Students majoring in the College of Arts and Sciences may only count up to 12 credit hours in naval science courses toward their degree. Courses cross listed between naval science and other departments of the College of Arts and Sciences are not included in this restriction.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students enrolled in the NROTC program must take 17 credits in naval science subjects to earn a commission and should schedule HIST 304 and ALEC 302 at the time of asking their College of Arts and Sciences adviser for approval of their program.</p>
				<p class="title-1">Aerospace Studies/Air Force ROTC</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students who are considering seeking a commission in the Armed Forces should be aware that Department of Defense regulations impose standards of personal and sexual conduct on Armed Forces personnel, as reflected in the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which may not be consistent with University Equal Opportunity standards. For information on these policies contact any one of the commanders of UNL’s ROTC programs or Student Legal Services.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The Department of Aerospace Studies is a United States Air Force ROTC program offered at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln through a cooperative effort contractually agreed to by the Air Force and the University.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Eligibility and Enrollment</p>

Students register for Aerospace Studies the same way they sign up for any other course on campus. In addition to academic class, students are registered for the corresponding leadership lab.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">To contract with the Air Force at the start of the junior year or upon receipt of a scholarship, you must be a United States citizen and meet age and other requirements.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Programs</p>
				<p class="basic-text">You can participate in Air Force ROTC by enrolling in either the Four-Year or Three-Year program.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Scholarships/Benefits</p>
				<p class="basic-text">High school and college students compete for Air Force ROTC college scholarships. The scholarships provide full tuition, fees, and textbook allowance. Students on scholarship also receive a monthly tax-free allowance during the school year that ranges from $300-$500.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Curriculum</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Any University of Nebraska–Lincoln, Doane College, Nebraska Wesleyan, and Concordia University student may take Aerospace Studies academic courses for college credit.

				<p class="title-2">Military Obligation</p>
				<p class="basic-text">No military obligation results from enrolling in the freshman or sophomore courses in Aerospace Studies. A military obligation occurs only when a student enters the junior year of the program or accepts an Air Force ROTC scholarship. Students who complete Air Force ROTC are commissioned Second Lieutenants and will go on active duty in the United States Air Force after graduation from the University. The active duty service commitment varies from 4-10 years. (Pilots, navigators, and air battle managers incur a longer active duty commitment.)</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Delay for Graduate Education.</span> An Air Force ROTC student is commissioned upon graduation from the University. If students are qualified for and interested in working toward advanced degrees, deferment from active duty may be possible until graduate degrees have been completed.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Field Training Program</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Each student who successfully receives a competitive allocation to enter the junior year professional officer course (POC) program must attend one field training encampment. This training is held at Maxwell AFB, AL, during the summer between their sophomore and junior year. Field training emphasizes development of leadership abilities and informs students of the many challenging career opportunities available in the Air Force. Students receive travel allowances and pay for field training. All accommodations, clothing, and food are furnished. Successful completion of field training is required to enter the POC.</p>
