				<p class="title-1">Aerospace Department</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students who are considering seeking a commission in the Armed Forces should be aware that Department of Defense regulations impose standards of personal and sexual conduct on Armed Forces personnel, as reflected in the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which may not be consistent with University Equal Opportunity standards.

				<p class="basic-text">Aerospace Studies classes are open to all full-time students at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, as well as students at Nebraska Wesleyan University, Doane College (Crete), Concordia University (Seward), and Southeast Community College, who have “visiting student” arrangements with the University of Nebraska for Air Force ROTC. Students register for Aerospace Studies the same way they sign up for any other course on campus. In addition to academic class, students are registered for the corresponding leadership lab.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">To contract with the Air Force at the start of the junior year or upon receipt of a scholarship, you must be a U.S. citizen and meet age and other requirements.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Programs</p>
				<p class="basic-text">There are two ways you can participate in Air Force ROTC. You can enroll in either the Four-Year or Three-Year program. Upon graduation, all cadets are commissioned as second lieutenants in the United States Air Force and serve four years on active duty. Pilots, navigators, and air battle managers incur a longer active duty commitment.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Scholarships/Benefits</p>
				<p class="basic-text">High school and college students compete for Air Force ROTC college scholarships. The scholarships provide full tuition, fees, textbook allowance, and a monthly tax-free allowance during the school year ranging from $300-$500.</p>

				<p class="basic-text">Any University of Nebraska–Lincoln, Doane College, Nebraska Wesleyan, and Concordia University student may take Aerospace Studies academic courses for college credit.

				<p class="title-2">Credit Hours</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Credit hours earned by students enrolled in Aerospace Studies may be used to fulfill elective credit hour requirements for graduation for any college in the University.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Military Obligation</p>
				<p class="basic-text">No military obligation results from enrolling in the freshman or sophomore courses in Aerospace Studies. A military obligation occurs only when a student enters the junior year of the program or accepts an Air Force ROTC scholarship. Students who complete Air Force ROTC are commissioned Second Lieutenants and will go on active duty in the United States Air Force after graduation from the University. The active duty service commitment varies from 4-10 years.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Delay for Graduate Education.</span> An Air Force ROTC student is commissioned upon graduation from the University. If students are qualified for and interested in working toward advanced degrees, deferment from active duty may be possible until graduate degrees have been completed.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Field Training Program</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Each student who successfully receives a competitive allocation to enter the junior year professional officer course (POC) program must attend one field training encampment. This training is held at Maxwell AFB, AL, during the summer between their sophomore and junior year. Field training emphasizes development of leadership abilities and informs students of the many challenging career opportunities available in the Air Force. Students receive travel allowances and pay for field training. All accommodations, clothing, and food are furnished. Successful completion of field training is required to enter the POC.</p>
