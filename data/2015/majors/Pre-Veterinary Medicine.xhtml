<p class="faculty-list"><span class="faculty-list-bold">Interim Director: Don Beermann,</span> School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, 120C Vet Basic Sciences</p>
<p class="faculty-list"><span class="faculty-list-bold">Head:</span> <span class="faculty-list-bold">Larry Berger</span>, Department of Animal Science, C203 Animal Sciences</p>
<p class="basic-text">Individuals wishing to enter the four-year professional curriculum leading to the degree Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM), must first complete two or more years of pre-veterinary education. Courses taken during pre-veterinary education must satisfy the entrance prerequisites for the college of veterinary medicine of the person’s choice. At the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, it usually requires a minimum of three years to complete the pre-professional requirements.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">The Pre-Veterinary Program is NOT a degree-granting program. </span>Completion of the pre-veterinary program alone in fulfilling the prerequisites for admission to a college or school of veterinary medicine does not result in the awarding of a degree from the University of Nebraska. Students are encouraged to consider courses of study with a degree-granting program in veterinary science, veterinary technology, animal science, food science and technology, biochemistry or other fields compatible with the pre-veterinary program. Students can also complete pre-veterinary prerequisites with a degree program in wildlife or environmental studies, leading to a bachelor of science degree. It is also possible to pursue these pre-veterinary requirements in degree-granting programs outside the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources, such as the College of Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The program utilizes an “Advising Plus” model which involves faculty from the School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences and the Department of Animal Science. Pre-veterinary advising will guide students toward successful completion of requirements and application to veterinary school. Advisers will also expose students to opportunities in animal health and assist them in identifying an appropriate degree program as they progress in their studies.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students interested in veterinary medicine are encouraged to participate in the Pre-veterinary Club to learn about the exciting advancement and developments within the profession.</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">MAJOR REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p class="title-2">Pre-Veterinary Medicine Recommended Core</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">NOTE:</span> These requirements are based on the Professional Program in Veterinary Medicine (PPVM), or the cooperative program between the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Iowa State University. Students who are planning to attend other professional veterinary programs should check with those programs for any additions/deletions/changes to this set of requirements. Students should work with their advisers or contact Laura Hardin 402-472-7306, lhardin2@unl.edu to ensure their course work meets the requirements.</p>
