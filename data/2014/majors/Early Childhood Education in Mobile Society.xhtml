<p class="content-box-h-1">DESCRIPTION</p>

<p>Early Childhood Education in a Mobile Society (ECEMS) will prepare you to work in early childhood settings with young children whose family members are highly mobile. When you complete the program you will be qualified to work in a variety of programs that offer early care and education for children birth to age 8  and particularly those with highly mobile populations such as military installations. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is an online program offered as part of the Great Plains Interactive Distance Education Alliance. The Great Plains IDEA is a consortium of universities collaborating in the delivery of programs. As a student in this program you will enroll for all your coursework through UNL and you will graduate from UNL, but your online courses will be taught by faculty at each of the participating universities. Core courses (51 credits; identified under the heading ECEMS Requirements below) in this program are subject to differential tuition at the common Great Plains IDEA rate. For 2014-2015, this rate is $370 per credit hour. The Great Plains IDEA rate does not apply to tuition and fees for any remaining credit hours needed to complete the bachelor’s degree (i.e., ACE Requirements, minor and elective requirements). </p>
