<h4>Felony and Misdemeanor Convictions</h4>
<p>The Nebraska Department of Education policy requires that a person with any felony conviction or a misdemeanor conviction involving abuse, neglect, or sexual misconduct shall not be allowed to participate in pre-student teaching laboratory and classroom
experiences or student teach without approval of the Board of Education. To comply with this policy, the College of Education and Human Sciences will require each student to affirm under oath that he/she does not have any convictions in the above named
areas prior to each field experience. If a student does have any felony or any misdemeanor convictions, he/she is required to meet with the Certification Officer or the Director of Field Experiences as soon as possible.  To ensure that each individual complies with this
policy, all students who are pursuing a teaching certificate will be required to periodically complete a &ldquo;Personal and Professional Fitness&rdquo; form (PPF) as well as submit to two formal reviews of their criminal history, which is conducted by an independent
third party. The first review will be completed during the first semester of the individual&rsquo;s freshman year or upon the individual&rsquo;s transfer into the College of Education and Human Sciences. At that time, each student will complete the PPF form and will also be expected to submit a request for the review of their criminal history. The PPF form will again be completed and submitted as a part of the
application process for the Teacher Education Program. The final review, including the submission of the PPF form and the completion of a second criminal history check, will take place as part of the application process to student teach. Each student is
responsible for the cost of the two criminal history reviews.
