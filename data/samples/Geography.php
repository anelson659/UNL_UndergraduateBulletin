<h2 class="sec_header">Description</h2>

<p class="intro">The program of geography offers a wide variety of courses leading to the bachelor of arts and bachelor of science degrees in geography. The objectives of these programs are:</p>
<ol class="intro"><li>To support the goals of a broad liberal education by increasing awareness of the spatial, regional, and environmental aspects of the earth and its peoples; and </li><li>To provide a specialized knowledge of environmental processes, human-environment relations, American and foreign areas and cultures, and geographic techniques such as cartography, remote sensing and geographic information analysis</li></ol>
<p class="intro"> An education in geography prepares students for careers in government agencies (e.g., US Census Bureau, Defense Mapping Agency, as well as those involved with foreign service, land management, state tourism, health care delivery systems, environmental assessment, transportation development, land use planning, air traffic control, GIS and cartographic analysis) and a wide variety of businesses, particularly those concerned with environmental mapping, geographic information systems, and planning. A geography major also prepares students for graduate-level degrees in geography, law (especially environmental law), international business, urban and regional planning, and teaching at all levels.</p>

<h2  class="sec_header">Major in Geography</h2>
<p>The major in geography consists of seven mandatory courses with a common core in human-environment relations. Students should begin their programs with introductory physical and human courses, then move to courses dealing with environmental issues, world regions, and courses in techniques of acquiring and displaying geographic data. An undergraduate seminar which covers historical and philosophical aspects of geography as well as practical matters such as jobs and graduate schools, completes the set of mandatory courses. Beyond this core of required courses are nine hours of electives.
Undergraduate Adviser. David Wishart, 320 Hardin Hall, (472-3576)</p>
<h4>Graduate Work</h4>
<p> The advanced degrees of master of arts and doctor of philosophy in geography are offered. For details of these programs see the <a href="http://bulletin.unl.edu">Graduate Studies Bulletin</a>.</p>
MAJOR;
$major->admission = <<<ADMISSION
<h2  class="sec_header">Admission</h2> 
<h3>College Admission</h3>
<p>The entrance requirements for the College of Arts and Sciences are the same as the UNL General Admission Requirements (see &ldquo;Admission to the University&rdquo; on page 6). Students who are admitted through the Admission by Review process with core course deficiencies will have certain conditions attached to their enrollment at UNL. These conditions are explained under &ldquo;Removal of Deficiencies&rdquo; on page 6 of this bulletin.
In addition to these requirements, the College of Arts and Sciences strongly recommends a third and fourth year of languages. Four years of high school language will exempt students from the College of Arts and Sciences&rsquo; 16-hour language requirement. It will also allow students to continue language study at a more advanced level, and give more opportunity to study abroad.</p>
<h4>Transfer Students</h4>
<p>To be considered for admission a transfer student, Nebraska resident or nonresident, must have an accumulated average of C (2.0 on a 4.0 scale) and a minimum C average in the last semester of attendance at another college. Transfer students who graduated from high school January 1997 and after must also meet the UNL General Admissions Requirements. Those transfer students who graduated before January 1997 must have completed in high school 3 years of English, 2 years of the same foreign language, 2 years of algebra, and 1 year of geometry. Transfer students who have completed less than 12 credit hours of college study must submit either the ACT or SAT scores.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, hours earned at an accredited college are accepted by the University. The College, however, will evaluate all hours submitted on an application for transfer and reserves the right to accept or reject any of them. Sixty-six is the maximum number of hours the University will accept on transfer from a two-year college. Transfer credit in the major must be approved by the major adviser on a Request for Substitution Form to meet specific course requirements, group requirements, or course level requirements in the major. At least 9 hours in the major field must be completed at the University regardless of the number of hours transferred.</p>
<p>The College of Arts and Sciences will accept no more than 15 semester hours of C- and D grades from other schools. The C- and D grades cannot be applied toward requirements for a major or minor. This policy does not apply to the transfer of grades from UNO or UNK to UNL. All D grades may be transferred from UNO or UNK, but they are not applicable to a major or minor.</p>
<h4>Readmitted Students</h4>
<p>Students readmitted to the College of Arts and Sciences will follow the requirements stated in the bulletin published in the first year enrolled at UNL or in any bulletin in effect while they are enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences. Beginning with the 1990-91 bulletin, the bulletin followed may not be more than 10 years old at the time of graduation. A student must, however, meet the requirements from one bulletin only, and may not choose a portion from one bulletin and the remainder from another.</p>
<h3>Major/Department Admission</h3>
<p>No requirements beyond College of Arts and Sciences admission requirements.</p>
<h3>Admission GPA</h3>
<p>Not Applicable</p>
<h3>Admission Deficiencies</h3>
<p>You must remove entrance deficiencies before you can graduate from the College of Arts and Sciences. For students entering August 1997 or later and who graduated from high school January 1997 and after, courses taken to remove a high school core course deficiency may not be counted toward either the major, minor, college degree requirements, or university comprehensive education requirements. They may only be counted in the &ldquo;electives&rdquo; category in meeting degree requirements. The most common deficiencies are in foreign languages and mathematics.</p>
<p>For University policy, see &ldquo;Graduation Requirements&rdquo; on page 16.</p>
<h4>Removing Foreign Language Deficiencies</h4>
<p>A student who has had fewer than two years of one foreign language in high school will need 130 semester hours as a minimum for a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences. A student will also need to complete the &ldquo;102&rdquo; course in a language to clear the deficiency and the &ldquo;202&rdquo; course to complete the college graduation requirement in language.</p>
<h4>Removing Mathematics Deficiencies</h4>
<ol>
<li>A deficiency of one year of geometry can be removed by taking two high school geometry courses by Independent Study or by completing a geometry course from an accredited community college or a four-year institution. Neither of these options count for college credit.</li>
<li>A deficiency of the first year of algebra can be removed by taking two high school Algebra I courses through Extended Education (not for college credit).</li>
<li>A deficiency of the second year of algebra can be removed by taking MATH 95C (not for college credit) or MATH 100A (may be taken for college credit but does not apply toward graduation).</li>
<li>A student whose deficiency is the additional (fourth) year of mathematics that builds on algebra must successfully complete MATH 101, 102, or 103, or an equivalent course at another institution.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Removing Other Deficiencies</h4>
<p>Contact the Arts and Sciences Advising Center for specific courses to remove other entrance deficiencies.</p>

<h3>College General Education Requirements</h3>
<h4>Requirements for the Bachelor of Arts Degree</h4>
<p>Students who wish to graduate with a bachelor of arts degree must complete the College graduation requirements, the University ACE requirements, the College of Arts and Sciences distribution requirements, the requirements for a major, and the requirements for a minor or minors if required by the major.</p>
<h4>Requirements for the Bachelor of Science Degree</h4>
<p>The bachelor of science degree is characterized by a strong prescriptive major, an essential scientific base, and the inclusion of a general liberal education as an important aspect of the degree. Requirements for the BS are the same as those for the BA, with the following exceptions:</p> 
<h5>The Major</h5>
<p>The major must include between 50-70 credit hours including required collateral courses in other departments. For students who wish to acquire two majors in two departments, the departments will be asked to make some accommodation for the students.</p>
<h5>Scientific Base</h5>
<p>In addition to University ACE requirements and the College distribution requirements, a student must complete 60 semester hours in mathematics and natural sciences, including:</p>
<ol><li>At least one of the following quantitative courses: CSCE 235, MATH 104, PHIL 211, or any mathematics or statistics course numbered 106 or above, except MATH 200 and 201.</li>
<li>At least one natural or physical science course and at least 1 credit of  laboratory work, taken as part of a course or separately, from the following departments: biochemistry, biological sciences, chemistry, geosciences, or physics and astronomy,  ANTH 242/242L, GEOG 155, and the following geography techniques courses also apply: GEOG 317, 412, 414, 415, 417, 418, 419, 420, 422 and 425. Other courses that may be applied toward the 60 hour total include courses in actuarial science for which calculus or above is a prerequisite and up to 12 hours of scientific and technical courses offered by other colleges with approval of the academic adviser.</li>
</ol>
<h4>College Distribution Requirements</h4>
<p>The College of Arts and Sciences distribution requirements are designed to further the purposes of liberal education by encouraging study in several different areas. Courses satisfying these requirements may impart specialized knowledge or broadly connect the subject matter to other areas of knowledge.</p> 
<p>All requirements are in addition to University ACE requirements. A student may not use a single course to satisfy more than one of the following five distribution requirements. A student cannot use a single course to satisfy both an ACE outcome and a College distribution requirement. Independent study or reading courses and internships cannot be used to satisfy distribution requirements. To see a complete list of excluded courses, run a degree audit through WAM.</p>
<p>Courses from interdisciplinary programs will count in the same area as courses from the home/cross-listed department(s). See <a href="http://ascweb.unl.edu/academics/depts.html">http://ascweb.unl.edu/academics/depts.html</a> for a complete list.</p>
<h5>Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science  (19 credits + Language)</h5>

<li>Languages Classical and Modern: 0-6 hours<br />
Fulfilled by the completion of the 6-credit-hour second-year sequence in a single foreign language in one of the following departments: Classics and religious studies, modern languages and literatures, or anthropology. Instruction is currently available in Biblical Hebrew, Chinese, Czech, French, German, Greek, Japanese, Latin, Omaha, Russian, and Spanish. A student who has completed the fourth-year level of one foreign language in high school is exempt from the languages requirement.</li></ol>    

<p>In addition to the College of Arts and  Sciences distribution requirements, the bachelor of science degree requires students to complete 60 semester hours in the natural and mathematical sciences.</p>
<h5>Languages Exemption Policy</h5>
<p>UNL and Arts and Sciences will exempt or waive students from the UNL entrance requirement of two years of the same foreign language or from the College&rsquo;s language distribution requirement based on documentation only. The following are the options and procedures for documentation:</p> 
<h5>High School Transcripts</h5>
<ol>
<li>For the University entrance requirements, students must show an official high school transcript with two or more years of the same foreign language in high school.</li>
<li>For the College of Arts and Sciences College Distribution Requirements Area 5 languages requirement, students must show an official high school transcript with four or more years of the same foreign language in high school, or show evidence of graduation from a non-English-speaking foreign high school.</li>
<li>For the College of Arts and Sciences College Distribution Requirements Area 5 languages requirement, students whose native language is not English must show English as a Second Language study on an official high school transcript. Four years of ESL at the high school level (9th, 10th, 11th and 12th grades) will be the basis for a waiver of the Area I Language requirement.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Proficiency Examination at UNL</h5>
<ol>
<li>For the University entrance requirement, students who do not have transcript documentation can request to take a proficiency exam in the language. (This is not the same test as the Modern Languages Placement Exam.) However, UNL will provide testing only in the languages it teaches. Currently, these languages are:
<ul>
<li>French</li>
<li>German</li>
<li>Spanish</li>
<li>Russian</li>
<li>Czech</li>
<li>Japanese</li>
<li>Chinese</li>
</ul>
The Department of Modern Languages will oversee the test and provide written documentation to the Admissions Office that the student has passed the proficiency test at the 102 level.</li>
<li>For the College of Arts and Sciences College Distribution Requirements Area 5 requirement, the Department of Modern Languages will oversee the test at the 202 level. If the student passes the test, the department will sign the College Request for Waiver form and indicate the level of proficiency. The form is then forwarded to the Arts and Sciences Advising Center for approval.</li></ol>
<h5>Distance Education</h5>
<ol>
<li>For the University entrance requirement, students without transcript documentation who claim proficiency in a language not taught at UNL, have the option of seeking out a distance education program in languages. If the student completes the equivalent of 102 from an approved distance education program, the student will meet the UNL entrance requirement. The student must have the course work approved before he/she takes/completes the course as equivalent to 102 by the modern languages department. The student then completes the course and has the distance education program send the transcript to the Admissions Office.</li>
<li>For the College of Arts and Sciences College Distribution Requirements Area 5 languages, the student can seek out a distance education program and complete the equivalent of the 202-level course. The student must submit the request on the College Request for Substitution form and have the course work approved by the Department of Modern Languages and the assistant dean for Advising Services. The student then completes the course and has the distance education program send the transcript to the Admissions Office.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Third Language Option</h5>
<p>If a student demonstrates knowledge of two foreign languages at the 102 level, the College of Arts and Sciences may consider waiving two semesters of the four semester College Distribution Requirements Area 5 languages requirement. If this waiver were granted, the student would then be required to complete 101 and 102 in another (3rd language) at UNL.</p>
<h3>Minimum Hours Required for Graduation</h3>
<p>A minimum of 125 semester hours of credit is required for graduation from the College of Arts and Sciences. Students who enter the College with fewer than two units of one foreign language from high school are required to take 130 semester hours as a minimum for the bachelor of arts or bachelor of science degree.</p> 
<h3>Grade Rules </h3>
<h4>C- and D grades</h4>
<p>The College will accept no more than 15 semester hours of C- and D grades from other schools except for UNO and UNK. No transfer C- and D grades can be applied toward requirements in a major or a minor. No UNL C- and D grades can be applied toward requirements in a major or a minor.</p>
<h4>Pass/No Pass Limits</h4>
<p>University regulations for the Pass/No Pass (P/N) privilege state:</p>
<blockquote>The Pass/No Pass option is designed for your use by seeking to expand your intellectual horizons by taking courses in areas where you may have had minimal preparation.</blockquote>
<p>For students in Arts and Sciences, the University regulations for Pass/No Pass apply as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Neither the P nor the N grade contribute to your GPA.</li>
<li>P is interpreted to mean C or above.</li>
<li>A change to or from a Pass/No Pass may be made until mid-term (1/2 of the course).</li>
<li>The Pass/No Pass or grade registration cannot conflict with the policy of the professor, department, college, or University governing the grading option.</li>
<li>Changing to or from Pass/No Pass requires using the eNRoll system to change the grading option or filing a Drop/Add form with the Registration and Records, 107 Canfield Administration Building. After mid-term of the course, a student registered for Pass/No Pass cannot change to a grade registration unless the Pass/No Pass registration is in conflict with the policy of the professor, department, college, or University governing Pass/No Pass. The Pass/No Pass grading option is not available to students on academic probation unless the course is offered only on a Pass/No Pass basis.</li>
<li>The Pass/No Pass grading option cannot be used for the removal of C- or D or F grades.</li>
</ol>

<p>Pass/No Pass privileges in the College of Arts and Sciences are extended to students according to the following additional regulations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pass/No Pass hours can count toward fulfillment of University ACE requirements and college distribution requirements up to the 24-hour maximum.</li>
<li>Many Arts and Sciences departments and programs do not allow courses in the major or minor to be taken Pass/No Pass; students should refer to the department&rsquo;s or program&rsquo;s section of the bulletin for clarification. By college rule, departments can allow up to 6 hours of Pass/No Pass in the major or minor.</li>
<li>Freshmen and sophomores may enroll for no more than 6 hours of P/N work per semester.</li>
<li>Departments may specify that certain courses of theirs can be taken only on a P/N basis.</li>
<li>The college will permit no more than a total of 24 semester hours of P/N grades to be applied toward degree requirements. This total includes all Pass grades earned at UNL and other US schools.
    <em>NOTE: This 24-hour limit is more restrictive than the University regulation.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Students who wish to apply P/N hours to their major and minor(s) must obtain approval on a form that is available in the Arts and Sciences Advising Center, 107 Oldfather Hall.</p>
<h4>GPA Requirements</h4>
<p>A total grade point average of at least 2.0 is required.</p>
<h3>Transfer Credit Rules</h3>
<h4>Transfer Credit from Foreign Institutions</h4>
<p>Credit for courses taken at foreign universities and colleges will be transferred only after validation by the appropriate department. This evaluation may include examination of the student over subject matter studied at the foreign institution.</p>
<p>Normally credit is not given for pre-university work. In some instances, it may be possible to receive credit through satisfactory examination, such as Advanced Placement.</p>
<h4>Transfer Students with a Non-UNL Degree</h4>
<p>A transfer student who has received a bachelors degree from another institution must complete at least 30 hours of credit in residence at UNL in addition to transfer credit. Students must complete at least half of their major course work including 6 hours above 299 in their major, and 15 of the 30 hours required above 299 in residence. The student must complete all degree requirements for the arts and sciences degree.</p>
<h4>Transfer Course Restrictions</h4>
<p>Maximum 15 hours of C- and D grades are transferable from colleges outside UNL. The C- and D grades cannot apply to majors or minors. All C- and D grades from UNO or UNK may be transferred but they are not applicable to a major or minor.</p>

<p>Maximum 66 hours accepted from a community college.</p>

<h3>Course Level Requirements (Hour Requirement 300+)</h3>
<p>Thirty of the 125 (or 130) semester hours of credit must be in courses numbered above 299. Of the 30 hours above 299, 15 hours (1/2) must be completed in residence at UNL. NOTE: ALEC 397E and ALEC 397K do not count toward this 30 hours.</p>
<h3> Residency</h3>
<p>Students must complete at least 30 of the 125 (or 130) total hours for their degree at UNL. Students must complete at least 1/2 of their major course work including 6 hours above 299 in their major, and 15 of the 30 hours required above 299 in residence. Credit earned during study abroad may be used toward the residency requirement if students register through UNL and participate in prior-approved study abroad programs (see &ldquo;Study Abroad and Exchange Programs&rdquo; on page 20). Open enrollment and summer independent study courses do not count toward residence. However, 30 semester hours earned through open enrollment courses and summer independent study courses at UNL may be applied toward a degree from the College.</p>
<h3>Extended Education, Independent Study, Internship Credit</h3>
<p>There are many opportunities to earn college credit through the University of Nebraska&ndash;Lincoln Extended Education. Majors in the College of Arts and Sciences may apply a maximum of 30 hours of UNL open enrollment courses and summer reading courses toward the total number of hours required for the degree.</p>
