<h3>Advertising</h3>
<p>The advertising major prepares students for careers in a wide variety of communication-related areas. Recent graduates have been placed in more than 20 states and several other countries in diverse advertising careers such as retail and corporate advertising and marketing, media sales, brand management, media planning, account management, research, public relations, media relations, special event planning, Internet communications, copywriting and layout and design.
<p>The advertising faculty believes that a successful career must be built upon a solid foundation, an education that combines theory and practice. To achieve that end, the major offers courses in copywriting, layout, media planning, graphics, campaign development, research, management, and strategic communications. The curriculum is designed to emphasize strategy, planning and implementation in creative problem solving.
    
<p>Much emphasis is placed on individual relationships between faculty and students, an interaction vital to a student&rsquo;s creative development. A faculty adviser also helps each student tailor an academic plan to meet his or her interests and needs.
    
<p>In advertising and strategic communications classes, students often work with actual clients who present real-life problems. This experience gives students a professional perspective on problem-solving in many sectors including nonprofit, retail, small business and community organizations as well as large corporations. Students are encouraged to augment their academic experience with internships.
    
<p>The faculty, with many professional contacts both locally and nationwide, actively help place students in jobs within the state and throughout the country. Students interested in majoring in advertising should contact the college office in 147 Andersen Hall.

<h3>College General Education Requirements</h3> 
<p>To graduate with a bachelor of journalism degree, students must complete requirements from the following areas: the University ACE requirements, the College of Journalism and Mass Communications Distribution Requirements, the requirements for a major offered by the college, and the non-major requirements that are specific to the college.
<h5>College Distribution Requirements (19 credits + Foreign Language)</h5>
<p>The College distribution requirements (CDR) are designed to further the purposes of liberal education by encouraging study in several different areas. Courses satisfying these requirements may impart specialized knowledge or broadly connect the subject matter to other areas of knowledge. 
    All requirements are in addition to University ACE requirements. A student may not use a single course to satisfy more than one of the five College distribution requirements. A student cannot use a single course to satisfy both an ACE outcome and a College distribution requirement. Independent study courses and internships cannot be used to satisfy distribution requirements.
    The five College Distribution Requirements are as follows:
1.  Written Communication: 3 hours 
    To be selected from courses approved for ACE outcome 1.
2.  Natural, Physical and Mathematical Sciences: 7 hours 

From two different departments, including at least one lab science course from the natural or physical sciences. Lab courses may be selected from biochemistry, biological sciences, chemistry, geosciences, physics and astronomy, geography, and anthropology*. All other courses select from: biochemistry, biological sciences, chemistry, computer science and engineering, geosciences, mathematics, physics and astronomy, and statistics.
* see degree audit for approved geography and anthropology lab courses

3.  Humanities: 6 hours
    From two different departments, select from classics*, English, history, modern languages and literatures*, philosophy, and religious studies.*

5.  Languages Classical and Modern: 0-6 hours
    Fulfilled by the completion of 6 credit hours at the 200 level or above in a single foreign language in one of the following departments: classics and religious studies, modern languages and literatures, or anthropology. Instruction is currently available in Biblical Hebrew, Chinese, Czech, French, German, Greek, Japanese, Latin, Omaha, Russian, and Spanish. A student who has completed the fourth-year level of one foreign language in high school is exempt from the languages requirement.
Options for completion of language requirement:
<ol>
<li>Regular four-semester sequence: 101, 102, 201, and 202 (5, 5, 3, 3 hours for a total of 16)</li>
<li>Three-semester sequence: 101, 102, and 210 (5, 5, 6 hours for a total of 16)</li>
<li>101, 102 fall and spring semesters; 201, 202 summer sessions (5, 5, 3, 3 hours for a total of 16). This and the option below constitute the only possibilities to finish the complete requirement in one year.</li>

Students wishing to exercise this option must receive permission from the dean of the College of Journalism and Mass Communications.
    A transfer student with 11 or 12 semester hours of accepted credit in a single foreign language has two choices: a) to complete 201 and 202 in the same language; or b) to enroll in 202 with permission of the chair of the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures.
    A student from a foreign country who has demonstrated acceptable proficiency in his or her native language (other than English) is exempted from the Group J requirement without credit toward the degree. U.S. citizens who present acceptable evidence that their second language is English are exempted from the language requirement without credit toward the degree. All such students should see the dean of the College of Journalism and Mass Communications for this exemption.

o   C- and D Grades 
<p>The college will accept no more than 15 semester hours of grades less than a C from any program outside the University of Nebraska system. No grades less than a C will count toward a major, a minor, or concentration.

<li>P (pass) is interpreted to mean a grade of C or better. A student who earns a C- or lower will receive a grade of N.</li>
<li>After eight weeks, a student registered for   P/N cannot change to a grade registration unless the P/N registration is in conflict with a professor, department, college, or university policy governing P/N.</li>
<li>P/N is not available to students on academic probation unless the course is offered only that way.</li>
<li>For undergraduates, the 24-hour college limit shall apply. This limit does not include courses offered on a Pass/No Pass only basis or AP credit. This limit does apply to transfer courses from UNO, UNK, UNMC, and other institutions. It also applies to ES/IS courses.</li>
<li>P/N hours can count toward fulfillment of group requirements, including concentrations, up to the 24 credit hour maximum. No journalism major may take a journalism course Pass/No Pass.</li>
<li>Students may change to Pass/No Pass until the eighth week (one-half course completion) if the    P/N registration is not in conflict with a professor, department, college or university policy governing the P/N option. Changing from graded to P/N or from P/N to graded can be completed on WAM! or by filing a drop/add form with the Office of Registration and Records, 107 Canfield Administration Building, and needs no instructor&rsquo;s approval.</li>
