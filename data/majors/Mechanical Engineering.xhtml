				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Mechanical engineering is concerned with all forms of energy conversion and transmission; the flow of fluids and heat; the development, design, and operation of machinery and equipment, material structure and properties; and transportation processes. The course of study is designed to give the student fundamental preparation to enter the fields of research, design, operation, production, sales, or management.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The Department of Mechanical Engineering is structured into three major academic areas: thermal-fluid science engineering, systems and design engineering, and materials science engineering. From these three major areas, a student can develop an emphasis area of study by utilizing the various technical elective courses in the major academic areas or an emphasis area could be directed toward studies in aerospace engineering, automotive engineering, robotics, biomedical engineering, computational methods, and others depending upon the technical courses available and the interest of the student.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Mission and Objectives</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The mission of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln, is to provide quality educational programs for undergraduate and graduate students planning careers in mechanical engineering or allied fields; to create and disseminate knowledge through research, publication, and other scholarly activities; to engage in professional activities to promote the mechanical engineering profession; and, to provide support to enhance the economic well-being of the state and the nation.</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Objectives.</span><span class="generated-style"> The undergraduate and graduate programs offered by the Department of Mechanical Engineering are intended to prepare students for successful careers and lifelong learning in mechanical engineering or allied fields in which the academic discipline serves as an educational base. Specifically, the program objectives of the Department are:</span></p>
				<ul>
