This major provides an appropriate vehicle for premedical, predental, nursing, physical therapy, and laboratory technology majors who may be able to obtain a degree in nutrition and simultaneously meet entrance requirements for a professional program. It is also a suitable avenue for students interested in nutrition research and graduate study since it provides an opportunity to emphasize the basic sciences. </p>				<p class="content-box-h-1">ADMISSION</p>				<p class="basic-text"> NOTE: The admission requirements for pre-professional programs vary and may change from year to year. Admission to professional programs is competitive. Students need to be aware of not only specific course requirements but also entrance exams, admission deadlines, research and volunteer opportunities, and other activities that enhance the application. In order to receive the most timely information on requirements and preparation, students should visit the Arts and Sciences Advising Center, 107 Oldfather Hall, 472-4190. </p>				<p class="content-box-h-1">MAJOR REQUIREMENTS </p>				<p class="title-1">Specific Major Requirements</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-1">Nutrition and Health Sciences (21 hrs)</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2"><span class="requirement-ital">Only grades of C or above will count toward graduation requirements for NUTR courses.</span></p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">NUTR 250 Human Nutrition &amp; Metabolism (3 hrs)</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">NUTR 344 Food &amp; Nutrition for Healthy Living (3 hrs)</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">NUTR 401 Health Behavior <span class="requirement-bold">or</span> NUTR 403 Physiological Foundation of Health &amp; Disease (3 hrs)</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">NUTR 402 Facts &amp; Fiction in Fitness &amp; Foods (3 hrs)</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">NUTR 450 Medical Nutrition Therapy I (3 hrs)</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">NUTR 452 Medical Nutrition Therapy II (3 hrs)</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">NUTR 455 Advanced Nutrition (3 hrs)</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-1">Supporting Courses (7 hrs)</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">CEHS 200 Families, Schools &amp; Communities <span class="requirement-ital">(hours met in ACE)</span> (0 hrs)</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">EDPS 459 Statistics Methods <span class="requirement-bold">or</span> STAT 218 Intro to Statistics <span class="requirement-ital">(hours met in ACE)</span> (0 hrs)</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">NUTR 253 Cultural Aspects of Food &amp; Nutrition <span class="requirement-bold">or</span> COMM 211 Intercultural Communication <span class="requirement-bold">or</span> SOCI 200 Women in Contemporary Society <span class="requirement-bold">or</span> SOCI 217 Nationality &amp; Race Relations <span class="requirement-ital">(hours met in ACE)</span> (0 hrs)</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">PSYC 181 Intro to Psych (4 hrs)</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">MATH 101 College Algebra or higher, trigonometry or calculus (3 hrs)</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-1">Supporting Sciences (37-40 hrs)</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">BIOC 431 Biomolecules &amp; Metabolism (4 hrs)</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">BIOL 101 &amp; BIOL 101L General Biology &amp; Lab <span class="requirement-bold">or</span> BIOS 102 Cell Structure &amp; Function <span class="requirement-bold">or</span> BIOS 103 Organismic Biology <span class="requirement-ital">(hours met in ACE)</span> (0 hrs)</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">BIOS 213 &amp; BIOS 213L Human Physiology &amp; Lab (4 hrs)</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">BIOS 214 Human Anatomy (5 hrs)</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">BIOS 312 &amp; BIOS 314 Fundamentals of Microbiology &amp; Lab (4 hrs)</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">CHEM 109 General Chemistry I <span class="requirement-bold">or</span> CHEM 113 Fundamental Chemistry I (4 hrs)</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">CHEM 110 General Chemistry II (4 hrs) <span class="requirement-bold">or</span> CHEM 114 Fundamental Chemistry II &amp; CHEM 116 Quantitative Chemistry Lab (5 hrs) (4-5 hrs)</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">CHEM 251 &amp; CHEM 253 Organic Chemistry &amp; Lab (4 hrs)</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">PHYS 141 &amp; PHYS 142 Elementary General Physics I &amp; II (5 hr ea) <span class="requirement-bold">or</span> PHYS 211 &amp; PHYS 212 General Physics I &amp; II (4 hr ea) (8-10 hrs)</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-1">Professional Supporting Courses (8-11 hrs)</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2"><span class="requirement-ital">Select from any of the following:</span> BIOC 432 Gene Expression &amp; Replication (2 hrs); BIOS (any course 200 or above); CHEM (any course 200 or above); FDST (any course 400 or above); MATH 102 Trigonometry (or higher); NUTR 484 Physiology of Exercise (3 hrs); PHIL 213 Medical Ethics (3 hrs); PHYS (any course 200 or above); PSYC 380 Abnormal Psychology (3 hrs); VBMS (any course 300 or above)</p>				<p class="title-1">Electives</p>				<p class="basic-text">Electives (10-16 hrs) </p>				<p class="content-box-h-1">ADDITIONAL MAJOR REQUIREMENTS</p>				<p class="title-1">Grade Rules</p>				<p class="title-2">Grades earned at UNL, UNO, UNK</p>				<p class="basic-text">Grades of D-, D, D+, C- satisfy requirements of the programs in human sciences unless specified otherwise under the Programs and Departments section of the bulletin.

Students can earn no more than 12 hours of pass credit excluding courses offered on Pass/No Pass only basis. Not all classes can be taken under the Pass/No Pass option. All courses, specified by course and number, must be taken for a grade. Should a student have earned a P in one of the courses prior to starting the option, the P will be reviewed by the appropriate department.</p>				<p class="content-box-h-1">MINOR REQUIREMENTS</p>				<p class="title-1">ACE Requirements</p>				<p class="basic-text">All UNL students who are following the 2009-10 bulletin will be required to complete a minimum of 3 hours of approved course work in each of the 10 designated ACE Student Learning described on the ACE Web site (ace.unl.edu). </p>				<p class="title-2">Achievement-Centered Education (31 hrs)</p>				<p class="list">ACE 1: Written Texts Incorporating Research &amp; Knowledge Skills</p>				<p class="list-indent">Select one course (3 hrs)</p>				<p class="list">ACE 2: Communication Skills</p>				<p class="list-indent">Select one course (3 hrs)</p>				<p class="list">ACE 3: Mathematical, Computational, Statistical or Formal Reasoning Skills</p>				<p class="list-indent">Met with professional requirement EDPS 459 or STAT 218 (3 hrs)</p>				<p class="list">ACE 4: Study of Scientific Methods &amp; Knowledge of the Natural &amp; Physical World</p>				<p class="list-indent">Met with professional requirement BIOL 101 &amp; BIOL 101L General Biology &amp; Lab or BIOS 102 Cell Structure &amp; Function or BIOS 103 (4 hrs)</p>				<p class="list">ACE 5: Study of Humanities</p>				<p class="list-indent">Select one course (3 hrs)</p>				<p class="list">ACE 6: Study of Social Sciences</p>				<p class="list-indent">Met with professional requirement CEHS 200 (3 hrs)</p>				<p class="list">ACE 7: Study of the Arts to Understand Their Context &amp; Significance</p>				<p class="list-indent">Select one course (3 hrs)</p>				<p class="list">ACE 8: Ethical Principles, Civics &amp; Stewardship &amp; their Importance to Society</p>				<p class="list-indent">Select one course (3 hrs)</p>				<p class="list">ACE 9: Global Awareness of Knowledge of Human Diversity through Analysis of an Issue</p>				<p class="list-indent">Met with professional requirement NUTR 253 or SOCI 200 or SOCI 217 (3 hrs)</p>				<p class="list">ACE 10: Integration of Abilities &amp; Capacities in a Creative or Scholarly Product</p>				<p class="list-indent">Department designated course (3 hrs)</p>			</div>		</div>	</body></html>
