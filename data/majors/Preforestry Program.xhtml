Students must transfer at the end of the freshmen or sophomore year to a forestry program accredited by the Society of American Foresters in order to obtain a professional forestry degree. An agreement with the University of Missouri-Columbia allows Nebraska residents with the proper scholastic qualifications to enter that institution without paying out-of-state fees. Students interested in transferring to a school other than the University of Missouri should obtain information about the school’s entrance requirements as early as possible to avoid unnecessary loss of credit. </p>				<p class="basic-text">The preforestry curriculum consists of 60-70 hours selected with the assistance of the student’s academic adviser and based on their background and career objectives. </p>				<p class="title-2">Typical courses include:</p>				<p class="list">BIOS 101 &amp; BIOS 101L General Biology &amp; Lab</p>				<p class="list">BIOS 109 General Botany</p>				<p class="list">BIOS 112 &amp; BIOS 112L Intro to Zoology &amp; Lab</p>				<p class="list">CHEM 109 &amp; CHEM 110 General Chemistry I &amp; II</p>				<p class="list">COMM 109 Fundamentals of Human Communication <span class="faculty-list-bold">or</span> COMM 209 Public Speaking</p>				<p class="list">ENGL 150 Writing: Rhetoric as Inquiry <span class="faculty-list-bold">or</span> ENGL 254 Writing &amp; Communities</p>				<p class="list">MATH 104 Calculus for Managerial &amp; Social Science <span class="faculty-list-bold">or</span> MATH 106 Analytic Geometry &amp; Calculus I</p>				<p class="list">NRES 103/AGRI 103 Intro to Agricultural &amp; Natural Resource Systems </p>				<p class="list">PHYS 141 Elementary General Physics I <span class="faculty-list-bold">or</span> PHYS 151 Elements of Physics</p>				<p class="list">SOIL 153 Soil Resources</p>				<p class="basic-text">All of these courses apply to a degree in natural resources for those students choosing to stay at the University of Nebraska and change majors to another degree program in the School of Natural Resources.</p>				<p class="end">###</p>			</div>		</div>	</body></html>
