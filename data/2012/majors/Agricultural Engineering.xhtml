				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Agricultural engineering (AGEN) is one of two engineering degree programs offered in the Department of Biological Systems Engineering. AGEN allows students to emphasize course work in one of three engineering areas; machine design, test, or soil and water resources. Thus, some agricultural engineers are involved in the analysis and design of field machinery systems and machine components through study of the principles of mechanical design, joining techniques, hydraulics, controls, ergonomics, and safety. Others are evaluating machine or mechanical system functional performance based on study of test procedure standards, measurements, data acquisition, electronic communication and statistics, and practical experience gained at the Nebraska Tractor Test Laboratory. Still others are analyzing and designing soil and water management-related infrastructure as aided through study of irrigation, drainage, erosion and runoff control techniques, crop tillage and cultivation practices and natural resources management. Job opportunities for graduates are available in industry, public agencies, consulting, and private practice.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">By two to six years after graduation, AGEN graduates (whether they are involved in machine design, product and performance testing, soil and water resources, or other professional endeavors such as business or law) will be:</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">applying their unique educational backgrounds in agricultural engineering by providing appropriate solutions to problems and adding value to the research, development, and design processes encountered in a variety of work environments;</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">considering systems as a whole when solving problems, looking beyond components and subsystems individually;</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">confidently using the necessary elements of mathematics, statistics, physical science, engineering, computer-based measurement and analysis tools and current literature in solving problems and providing design solutions;</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">successfully integrating their technical knowledge with organization, communication, and interpersonal skills, leading and working effectively in teams, and understanding cultural diversity and social and political forces that impact engineering decisions, as well as having the capability of competing in an international atmosphere;</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">responsibly addressing issues of health and safety, ethics, and environmental impacts of engineering decisions; and</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">continuing their personal growth, professional development, and professional and community service, through various opportunities provided by institutions, professional organizations and other venues.</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The Department of Biological Systems Engineering is located in Chase Hall on East Campus. AGEN students participate in classes and laboratories on both the East and City Campuses. AGEN courses are offered on the East Campus. Basic courses in math, chemistry, physics, engineering, computers, and electives in mechanical, civil, electrical, industrial, and chemical engineering are taken on the City Campus. Convenient bus transportation is available between campuses.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students benefit from small classes and personal acquaintances with faculty. In consultation with their adviser, students select electives that permit specialization in an emphasis area applicable to their career aspirations. Many students work part-time on departmental research projects, gaining valuable experience for graduate study and future employment. Students also benefit from summer jobs, internships and co-op programs. These opportunities give students practical experience to learn about careers in engineering. Students also gain valuable experience through participation in professional organizations such as the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers, the Soil and Water Resources Club, the Nebraska Society of Professional Engineers and the Society for Women Engineers.</span></p>
