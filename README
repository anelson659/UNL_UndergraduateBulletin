This is the source for the 2010-2011 UNL Undergraduate Bulletin website.

*** SETUP ***
Required:
PHP 5.3 & Phar extension

The www dir is where the web files are stored, and should be the served root.
Copy the www/sample.htaccess to www/.htaccess and configure as necessary.
Copy the config.sample.php to config.inc.php.


*** THE DATA ***
Course data is pulled from the creq.unl.edu web service and is cached within 
the data/creq directory. Run the update.sh script to retrieve the latest course
data.

College and major information is stored in the data directory and contains epub
exports from Adobe InDesign. Judy Anderson maintains the content for these 
files, and is repsonsible for updating them and re-exporting the epub files.

Once a new epub file is generated, simply drop it in the respective directory.

*** CACHED OUTPUT ***
All output is cached within /tmp/unlcache_5174748813ed8803e7651fae9d2d077f_*
files.

*** LIBRARIES ***
Libraries are bundled within the includes directory. This is a Pyrus controlled
registry of PEAR installable packages.
